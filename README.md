## 🎯 Vision

I created this app for **myself, students, professionals, and creatives to save time, reduce stress, and enhance productivity**. By creating an immersive focus environment, Solomon Christ AI - Productivity App helps you build positive work habits and achieve a 'flow state' on demand.

## ❓ Why Was This Made?

In a world full of distractions, maintaining focus is a major challenge. Many people struggle with:
- Procrastination and difficulty starting tasks.
- Juggling multiple tools (timer, to-do list, music player).
- Being able to customize a tool to achieve flow state on YOUR TERMS!

**This app solves these problems by providing a single, cohesive solution:**
- A **structured Pomodoro timer** to break down work into manageable intervals.
- An **integrated task list** to clarify your goals for each session.
- **Customizable soundscapes** that YOU get to choose.
- **Gamification** to motivate you and reward consistency.

## ⚙️ Data & Configuration

### Import / Export Settings
You can easily save and transfer your entire setup. In the **Timer Settings** panel, you will find **Import** and **Export** buttons.
- **Export:** Click this to download a `solomon-christ-ai-app-settings.json` file containing all your timer durations, custom audio URLs, tasks, and stats.
- **Import:** Click this to upload a previously exported `.json` file to instantly restore your configuration on any device.

### Hard-Coding Default Values (For Developers)
If you want to create a custom, offline version of the app with your own default settings, you can edit the configuration files directly:
- **Timer Durations & Sounds:** Open `constants.ts` and modify the values inside the `DEFAULT_TIMER_SETTINGS` object.
- **Music & Themes:** In the same file (`constants.ts`), you can change the default MP3 URLs for `FOCUS_MODES_CONFIG` and `THEME_CONFIG`.
